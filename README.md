XMLtoJSON
=========

Allows for a simple way to submit any request to an xml  api and get json back instead

The code is designed in a way that you pass the xml api and url encoded it. The api uses a stringbulder to create a long string and handle the encoding. 
The source of the methods that provide the fuctionality are open source. The goal of this is provide a simple way to consume
any xml site from a mobile or web app without having to create a parser and shipping it with an app. 

I HAve depolyed this for my self as a free website in an azure instance. as long as you do not need to hit the endpoint a huge amount this will work well.
